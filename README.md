# Receipt Trakr

## An app to keep record of receipts
This project is using the
[Browser Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/browser-template)
from General Assembly.

### User Stories

As a user, I want to:
- Track details of my receipt including, company, amount, product, and purpose (business/pleasure).
- Search through receipts by tracked property.
- Upload an image of my receipt.

### ERD

This app will have two resources, User and Receipt. The association between the two will consist of a User having many Receipts and Receipts belonging to a User.
